# Navigation

We all know that in space there is in theory no friction. This allows for
infinite acceleration. The challenge however is to make sure you don't
overshoot while traveling.

Moving to a location in space require a ship to accelerate into the direction
of that position, and decelerate to avoid overshooting the target. As a result
you would get a sinus wave shape when plotting the speed of the vehicle during
travel towards the location.

Having more powerful trusters shortens the traveling time as it makes the
sinus wave steeper.

## Speed

Travel speeds are determined by the weight of the ship and the total amount of
trusters. Using heavier materials to build ship components will make the ship
heavier then using lighter materials.

## Trigger

Traveling requires one to define the target. This initiates the thrusters. It
is not possible to alter the trajectory of travel during traveling.

## Battle

During travel the chance of hitting a target is harder. It's also harder to hit
a target that is on the move. One has to take speed, direction and traveling
time into account to increase the chance of hitting an opponent squarely.
