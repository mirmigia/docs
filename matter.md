# Matter

Matter comes in many shapes, sizes and properties.

The properties of matter are determined by the composition of smaller parts
within the matter. It consists out of base elements named protos, neutros and
electros.

These have values that range between 1 till 32.

The more parts matter has the heavier it is. The weight is the sum of all the
base elements.

For matter to have a certain property it has to overlap with the property
fingerprint. Each of the properties have a color. The opposite color is the
"kryptonite" of the material. Meaning that shields that are hit by the opposite
color shell more easily compromised.

Or maybe have opposites not do damage at all and instead of neighboring
elements be more effective against one and other.
