# Mining

> Mining is the activity of acquiring resources. These can be used to
> manufacture products.

## Interaction

Mining can be performed when within landing radius of a minable game object.
When near such an object, the minable [materials](matter.md) reveal themselves.
This makes it possible to select which of the materials one would want to mine.

## Duration

The mining of matter is a long process. Planets can be mined for actual weeks and
still not be depleted of their resources. Not because they have that many
resources but also because mining takes long.

## Storage

Storing mined resources requires the object that is performing the minning to
have [warehouse](warehouse.md) capacity. Mining activities are immediately
halted when the warehouse reaches it's max capacity.
